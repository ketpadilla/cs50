If songs.db does contain the necessary data to calculate the audio aura as done by Spotify,
theoretically speaking, it should be characterized by the following sqlite 3 syntax:
SELECT AVG(energy+valence+danceability) FROM songs;.

Hypothesizing that this method of calculating such aura is not representative of the listener,
the method should also account for: how long the listerner listened to each song;
how many times the listerner listened to each song; and many more.

The method could also be revised to utilize a more dynamic system of calculating audio aura.
Such an example would be using machine learning to account for variables that cannot be
mathematically expressed like the listerner's personality, demographic information, and more.
